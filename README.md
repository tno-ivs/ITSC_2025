This workshop will be held at the 28th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), on November 18 - 21, 2025 Gold Coast, Australia

# Workshop summary
Motorcyclists are among the most vulnerable road users, with significantly higher fatality and injury rates per kilometer traveled than car occupants, and the highest risk among motorized vehicle users. According to NHTSA and the Insurance Information Institute, motorcyclists experience 25.67 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT), compared to 0.94 for passenger cars—making the risk approximately 27 times higher.
Despite advances in vehicle automation and intelligent transportation systems (ITS), motorcycle safety has received limited dedicated attention within the ITS research community. This workshop will showcase work from the Connected Motorcycle Consortium, where industry, research institutes, policymakers, and universities collaborate to address motorcycle-specific safety challenges. We also invite contributions
from other domains to share complementary approaches and lessons learned. A panel discussion will explore how motorcycle safety research can be more effectively embedded in the ITS community.
Key topics include sensor and perception challenges in detecting and predicting motorcycle behavior, advanced rider assistance systems (ARAS), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, and integration into cooperative ITS environments. Special attention will be given to human-centered design, including rider behavior modeling, risk perception, and rider warning design.
The workshop aims to build a stronger research community focused on reducing motorcycle-related crashes and injuries.
